      Bubble Tea is usually made with four ingredints. Milk, sugar, black tea,
      and tapioca balls.

      The tapioca balls in bubble tea have intreseting chewy taste that goes
      very nicely with the bubble tea. You can order bubble tea without the
      balls if you don't like them though.

      Back in the 1600s during the partial Dutch colonization of Taiwan, the
      combination of tea, milk, and sugar was introduced and became popular in
      Taiwan. This milk tea drinking culture endured up to modern times. It was
      also during the colonization times that tapioca was introduced to Taiwan
      (and Asia in general). Tapioca comes from the cassava root, a plant native
      from South America. This introduced another type of starch in Asia and
      Southeast Asia. Tapioca starch versions of already familiar dishes started
      to become more popular over time. For example, sago pearls were slowly
      replaced by tapioca pearls, mainly due to tapioca being a cheaper option.
      So before bubble tea was invented, shaved iced and tapioca pearls were
      already relatively common desserts in Taiwan.

      The Hanlin Tea Room of Tainan claims that bubble tea was invented in 1986.
      The story says that the teahouse owner Tu Tsong-he saw tapioca balls in
      the local market of Ah-bó-liâu. There he thought of the idea of using the
      tapioca pearls in his tea. Thereafter, this new tea with tapioca bubbles
      which was shaken creating more bubbles (i.e. bubble tea!) became a hot
      seller at his shop. Hanlin now operates over 80 branches of his shop in
      Taiwan and around the world..

      The founder of the Chun Shi Tang tea room in Taichung, Liu Han-Chieh,
      visited Japan during the 1980s. There she was served cold coffee. Inspired
      by Japan, she decided to serve cold Chinese tea. This new technique did
      wonders for her business. Soon, multiple chains were established that
      started serving cold tea. According to the product development manager of
      the company, she invented the first bubble tea in 1988. During a staff
      meeting, she poured tapioca balls into her cold tea and gave it to
      everyone to drink. Everyone in the company loved the boba. Soon, the newly
      invented bubble tea became popular and the top-selling product.
